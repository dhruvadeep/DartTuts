An exception is an error occurred at runtime because Dart runtime could not execute a 
statement successfully or any other thousand reasons. When an exception is thrown, there is 
a good chance that our program will crash.

To save our program from crashing, we need to catch an exception. This is done using try 
catch/finally block you might already be familiar with. Letâ€™s take a classical example of 
dividing a number by zero.
