/**
 * An exception thrown by the runtime can be catched using `try/catch/finally` blocks.
 * try: This is where we execute code that can potentially raises an execption.
 * catch: This is where we do some error handling when an exception was thrown.
 * finally: This block always execute whether an exception was raised or now.
 *
 * The try-catch statement is used to prevent accidental termination of the program.
